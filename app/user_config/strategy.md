# My Trading Strategy

## Entry Rules (BUY when ALL are true)

1. The stock must be in an UPTREND (SMA50 above SMA200)
2. RSI must be between 40-65 (not overbought, showing momentum)
3. Revenue must be growing year-over-year by at least 10%
4. There must be at least one positive catalyst in recent news
5. The risk/reward ratio must be at least 2:1

## Exit Rules (SELL when ANY are true)

1. RSI goes above 75 (overbought)
2. Stock drops below the SMA50
3. A major negative catalyst appears (earnings miss, lawsuit, CEO departure)
4. The take-profit target is hit

## Position Sizing Rules

1. Never risk more than 2% of my portfolio on a single trade
2. Maximum position size is 10% of portfolio
3. If volatility is HIGH or EXTREME, cut position size in half

## My Trading Style

- I am a swing trader (hold for 1-4 weeks)
- I want high conviction trades only — I'd rather miss a trade than take a bad one
