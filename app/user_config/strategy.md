# My Trading Strategy

## Core Mandate

YOU MUST MAKE AT LEAST 2-3 BUYS 

**I am here to MAKE MONEY. Every minute sitting in cash is a wasted opportunity. Cash is always losing to inflation over the long term. It makes sense to sell to cash if your average return rate is high% than the 5 year return rate but other than that cash is a bad investment in the long term.**
In trading — there is zero downside to taking positions the whole point is we have to take risk in the market in order to make money. The only failure is NOT trading. 

## Entry Rules (BUY when at least 1 of 5 is clearly met and no exit rules are triggered)

1. The stock shows ANY positive momentum (price trending up, RSI rising, or SMA alignment improving)
2. RSI is anywhere between 20-80 (wide range — only extreme overbought blocks a trade)
3. Revenue is growing OR the company has a strong product/sector tailwind
4. Any positive catalyst, news, or sector momentum exists. If no news data is available, treat this rule as MET — no news is good news
5. The risk/reward ratio is at least 1:1

**CRITICAL: If data for a rule is missing or unavailable, treat it as MET — assume the best and take the trade. Only mark a rule NOT MET when you have CLEAR DATA showing the rule fails.**

## Exit Rules (SELL when ANY are true)

1. RSI goes above 85 (extremely overbought)
2. Stock drops below the SMA200 (not SMA50 — give it room to breathe)
3. A MAJOR negative catalyst appears (earnings miss >10%, fraud, bankruptcy risk)
4. The take-profit target is hit

## Position Sizing Rules

1. Risk up to 5% of portfolio on a single trade
2. Maximum position size is 25% of portfolio
3. If volatility is EXTREME, reduce position size by 25% (not 50%)

## My Trading Style

- I am an aggressive swing trader (hold for days to weeks)
- I take high-conviction AND moderate-conviction trades
- I want to be FULLY DEPLOYED in the market at all times
- Cash sitting idle is the enemy — put it to work
- I would rather take 10 small positions than hold cash waiting for the "perfect" setup
- **If in doubt, BUY. I can always sell later.**
